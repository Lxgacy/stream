# Stream repository

I've decided to document anything regarding [the stream](#the-stream) in english. On the one hand to improve my english skills overall and on the other hand to allow non german speaking people to unterstand what am I doing on stream and on this repository. [The stream](#the-stream) will for the time being not be in englisch (sorry mates).

Feel free to "pull request" changes if for typos, my bad english skills, ideas (**PLEASE DO THAT üòÅ**) or other things like suggestions for the stream or this repo.

## "The stream"

I think I have to define what "the stream" means. Over the last 4 1/2 years I mostly streamed Rocket League (and I will stream the game in the future also) **but** this repository and the [todos](#todos) will only for tech like streams, not for gaming streams.

Most of the streams will be made with my [hackintosh](#hackintosh)

## Todos

There is a [TODO file](TODO) in this repository that _should_ contain all todos for this repo and the streams

This is a list of done, potential or "denied" project (ideas).

    -   For specific commands or functions like light controls (just an idea)
-   Build a new Discord bot
